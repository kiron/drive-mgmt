# drive-mgmt
A set of scripts to manage the google drive. 

These scripts rely heavily on https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM/wiki . Please start there. 

We currently have scripts for: 
- mass creation of accounts from a csv 
- mass deletion of accounts (numbered)
- assiging all users of an organizational unit a google group 
- checking and resetting drive permissions as needed.
